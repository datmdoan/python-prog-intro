# An introduction to computer programming using Python

This collection of Jupyter notebooks and accompanying material form the basis of an interactive introduction to computer
programming taught to chemistry undergraduate students at Imperial College London. It benefits from an earlier
[course focussed on data analysis](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-data-viz-intro),
but does not build upon and does not depend on it.

As the name of the course suggests, the goal is not exactly to teach Python, but rather to use Python to teach
features and constructs that are common in many imperative programming languages. Object-oriented features in
Python are not covered, and therefore object specific methods are not used (in workshop 4, the convenience of some methods
when processing strings lead to deviations from this principle). These choices may seem odd to Python programmers
who will find more elegant ways of solving problems, but they keep the course shorter and more consistent, and hopefully
more approachable to beginner programmers. Still, it is expected that the students will develop a good basis to start reading
and working with Python code.

The structure of the course is as follows:

### [Workshop 1](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-prog-intro/blob/master/prog_workshop1/prog_workshop1.ipynb)

* Basic data types ---numbers (integers, floating point, complex),  strings, booleans--- and their operations.
* Conditional statements
* Variables
* Lists
* Other data structures

### [Workshop 2](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-prog-intro/blob/master/prog_workshop2/prog_workshop2.ipynb)

* *For* and *While* loops
* Defining functions (and a how to invoke methods)

### [Workshop 3](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-prog-intro/blob/master/prog_workshop3/prog_workshop3.ipynb)

* Using loops to do work; nested loop structures.
* Using external modules.
* Standalone scripts and prompting for input.

### [Workshop 4](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-prog-intro/blob/master/prog_workshop4/prog_workshop4.ipynb)

* Dealing with files: writing, reading, parsing.

In order to use the notebooks interactively in your computer you will need to have a python interpreter (version 3.x)
and the Jupyter notebook installed, both can be obtained, for example, by installing the
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

We are interested in your [feedback](mailto:chemistry-git@imperial.ac.uk) and to hear about other ways this material is being used.
